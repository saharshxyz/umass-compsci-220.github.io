# Opening an Assignment

How to download and open an assignment in VSCode.

## Opening an Assignment in VSCode

**1. Open your file browser and navigate to your CS220 folder**

- If you do not already have a CS220-specific folder, you should make one so all your files are grouped together. Place it somewhere easy to remember.

**2. Inside your CS220 folder, create a new folder for the assignment.**

**3. Download the provided ZIP file and place it inside the newly created assignment folder.**

- If you'd like to open the empty assignment, download [this ZIP](../../practice-assignments/01-empty-assignment/01-empty-assignment.zip).

**4. Right-click the ZIP archive and extract the contents into the folder.**

**5. Open VSCode, click on `File -> Open Folder...`, then navigate to the extracted contents.**

**6. Once you see the contents of the assignment (the folder containing a `package.json`), click `Open`.**

**7. Inside of VSCode, click on the explorer (top of the left sidebar) if it is not already revealed.**

- Your explorer should look very similar to this:

![Explorer](/img/vscode-explorer.png)

- After opening the folder, you may have received a notification on the bottom right of your screen prompting you to install some extensions. It is recommended that you do.

**8. Open a VSCode Terminal**

- Click on `Terminal -> New Terminal`.
- You should see a box on the bottom open up. This terminal is where you will execute commands to run, debug, test, and build assignments.
- **TIP: Use the up/down arrow keys to cycle through command history so you do not have to rewrite commands.**
- **TIP: Press tab to auto-complete**

**9. Run `npm install`**

- Inside the terminal, type the command `npm i` (shorthand for `npm install`), then press enter.
- You should see some output that mentions the dependencies being installed.
- After it has finished, you should see a new `node_modules/` folder in the explorer.

**10. Run the assignment**

- Run the command `npm run start` to run the `src/main.ts` file
- See more instruction is the [running and debugging document](./RUNNING_AND_DEBUGGING.md#running-an-assignment-in-vscode).

## Linting and Formatting Assignments

Assignments come configured with linting and formatting. Provided for you are the `npm run lint`, `npm run lint:fix`, and `npm run format` commands.

### Linting

From [Wikipedia on Lint](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lint_(software)>):

> Lint, or a linter, is a static code analysis tool used to flag programming errors, bugs, stylistic errors and suspicious constructs. The term originates from a Unix utility that examined C language source code.

Homework assignments may require that you do not have any linter warnings. To check your linter warnings, use the `npm run lint` command in a terminal. It will produce output detailing where and how your code could improve.

If you do not understand what the warning means, Googling its name may help ("@typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars").

Using the [VSCode ESlint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint) extension will bring these warnings into the editor visually. Allowing you to hover your cursor over them and interact with them.

The `npm run lint:fix` command will attempt to fix all the automatically fixable warnings. Such as using `let` for a variable that is never reassigned.

</p>

Above is some example output from running `npm run lint`. As you can see, on line 46, column 7, we are getting a warning because we define a variable `x`, but never use it.

### Formatting

Formatting, i.e. the spacing and visual structure of your code, is handled before you build your final submission using the `npm run format` command. If you'd like, you can run this command periodically to format your code. Alternatively, you could configure VSCode to automatically format your code whenever you save your file.

Installing the [Prettier extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode) in VSCode and adding the following to your `settings.json` (`File -> Preferences -> Settings -> Open JSON (top right)`) should configure it for you:

```json
"[typescript]": {
  "editor.defaultFormatter": "esbenp.prettier-vscode"
},
"editor.formatOnSave": true
```

Your code is formatted before you build your submission so it can be more easily read by course staff.
