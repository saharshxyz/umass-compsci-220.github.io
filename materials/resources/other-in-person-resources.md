## Tutoring

There is individual tutoring available through the CICS tutoring system and the LRC Tutoring program.

[The CICS Tutoring program](https://cicstutoring.freshdesk.com/support/tickets/new) is a great way to get individual support in a flexible way to review material, whether it’s as an overview, to clarify things for projects or exams, or just to talk to someone who has taken the course before. All CICS tutors have taken CS220 in the past and would love to help you out! To request tutoring, fill out the form. If you see an option to log in, you don’t need to - look for the button that says ‘submit a new ticket’ and follow from there.

[The LRC Tutoring program](https://www.umass.edu/lrc/) offers drop in tutoring sessions for CS220! You can go there to get help from a qualified student to help you with course material.

## Supplemental Instruction

There are review sessions run by a supplemental instructor. If you are enrolled in CS220, you should see a CS220-SI course on Moodle. Locations, times, recordings, and worksheets should all be posted there.

The SI session are run by the library, independent from the course staff.
