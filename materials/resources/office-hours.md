# Office Hours

We will be holding both in-person and virtual office hours this semester. All in-person TA and UCA office hours are held in LGRT 220 (the tower). Virtual office hours are on zoom, see the table below for the link.

Please do come to office hours for:

- Help with material or homework
- Exam review
- Logistical questions
- Reviewing past exams, quizzes, or homework
- Anything else you might need assistance with!

### The Office hour schedule will be released prior to the first day of classes.

## Holidays and Schedule Changes

During University scheduled Holidays, office hours will NOT be held unless otherwise noted. **When a different dayâ€™s class schedule is being followed, office hours will follow that schedule.** For example, if there was a holiday on Monday, then Tuesday might be designated to follow a Monday schedule. Thus a Monday office hour schedule applies. If any course staff is unable to hold their office hours, there will be announcement post made on Campuswire.
