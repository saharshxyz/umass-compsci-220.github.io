## Holidays and Schedule Changes

During University scheduled Holidays, office hours will NOT be held unless otherwise noted. **When a different dayâ€™s class schedule is being followed, office hours will follow that schedule.** For example, if there was a holiday on Monday, then Tuesday might be designated to follow a Monday schedule. Thus a Monday office hour schedule applies. If any course staff is unable to hold their office hours, there will be announcement post made on Campuswire.
