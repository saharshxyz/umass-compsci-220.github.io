# Office Hours

We will be holding both in-person and virtual office hours this semester. All in-person TA and UCA office hours are held in **LGRT 222** (the tower). Prof. Davila's office hour is held in his office (LGRC A137) and on zoom (https://umass-amherst.zoom.us/j/2581898802). Virtual office hours are on zoom, see the table below for the link.

Please do come to office hours for:
